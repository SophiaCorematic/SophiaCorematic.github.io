## Cats and Computers. Who will rule the world?

In a world of cats and computers so grand,<br> 
A feline tech whiz, a tale I command. <br> 
With paws so nimble, he'd dance on the keys,<br> 
Coding and hacking with greatest of ease,<br> 
A digital wizard, this cat could understand.<br> 

His fur, a sleek black, eyes sharp as a mouse,<br> 
He'd roam the web, searching for a new house.<br> 
From YouTube videos of kittens at play,<br> 
To online stores where catnip held sway,<br> 
He conquered the cyberspace, king of his own house.<br> 

When laptops went missing, he was to blame, <br> 
Curiosity sparked, he played his own game. <br> 
He'd chase the cursor, a digital prey, <br> 
As screens flickered with each paw's playful sway, <br> 
Leaving no keyboard or mousepad the same. <br> 

But beware, dear users, he'd cast his spell, <br> 
With a paw on the power button, all's well. <br> 
For in his feline wisdom, he'd make amends, <br> 
Ensuring systems ran smoothly, my friends, <br> 
A tech-savvy cat, beyond parallel. <br> 

So, cherish your cats and your computers alike, <br> 
For in their presence, you'll find sheer delight. <br> 
As whiskers twitch and code dances with grace, <br> 
Cats and computers, a purrfect embrace, <br> 
Creating a world where imagination takes flight.

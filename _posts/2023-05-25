## Cats and Computers

# A poem about the two and their beauty

In a world of cats and computers so grand,
A feline tech whiz, a tale I command.
With paws so nimble, he'd dance on the keys,
Coding and hacking with greatest of ease,
A digital wizard, this cat could understand.

His fur, a sleek black, eyes sharp as a mouse,
He'd roam the web, searching for a new house.
From YouTube videos of kittens at play,
To online stores where catnip held sway,
He conquered the cyberspace, king of his own house.

When laptops went missing, he was to blame,
Curiosity sparked, he played his own game.
He'd chase the cursor, a digital prey,
As screens flickered with each paw's playful sway,
Leaving no keyboard or mousepad the same.

But beware, dear users, he'd cast his spell,
With a paw on the power button, all's well.
For in his feline wisdom, he'd make amends,
Ensuring systems ran smoothly, my friends,
A tech-savvy cat, beyond parallel.

So, cherish your cats and your computers alike,
For in their presence, you'll find sheer delight.
As whiskers twitch and code dances with grace,
Cats and computers, a purrfect embrace,
Creating a world where imagination takes flight.
